    "In Python, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It is typically used to handle errors or unexpected situations that arise during runtime. Exceptions allow you to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",

    "Differences Between Exceptions and Syntax Errors\n",
    "1. Exceptions\n",
    "    Definition: Exceptions are errors detected during the execution of the program. They can be caused by various runtime issues such as division by zero, file not found, or invalid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Timing: Exceptions occur during runtime. They do not prevent the code from being executed but can interrupt the flow of execution when they are raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try, except, else, and finally blocks, allowing the program to continue running or to manage the error gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax Errors\n",
    "    Definition: Syntax errors occur when the code does not conform to the syntax rules of the Python language. These errors are usually due to mistakes in the code structure such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Timing: Syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase before the program is executed. They prevent the program from running and must be fixed before the code can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling: Syntax errors cannot be caught or handled using exception handling mechanisms since they occur before the program execution begins.\n"

    "1. Exception Propagation: The exception is propagated up the call stack. Python will search for an exception handler in the current scope. If it does not find one, it will move to the caller of the current function, and so on, until it reaches the top level of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Uncaught Exception: If no handler is found for the exception, Python's default behavior is to terminate the program. An error message is printed to the console, which includes the traceback (a report of the function calls leading to the exception) and the type of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Program Termination: The program will exit with a non-zero exit code indicating that an error occurred. This typically signals a failure in the program execution.\n"
