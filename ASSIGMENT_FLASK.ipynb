    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to be simple, lightweight, and flexible. It is often referred to as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. Flask provides the essential features of a web application, allowing developers to build web applications and APIs quickly and easily. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.\n",

    "-> Advantages of Flask Framework:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight and Flexible:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Flask is a microframework, meaning it has a small core with simple, unopinionated components. This makes it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ->Developers have the freedom to structure their applications as they see fit, using only the components they need.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    ->Flask has a straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax, making it accessible for beginners.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ->The documentation is extensive and well-organized, providing clear guidance for developers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Modular Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Flask supports modular design, allowing developers to break down their applications into smaller, reusable components.\n",
    "    -> Extensions can be added to Flask to provide additional functionality, such as authentication, form validation, and database integration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Extensible:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Flask has a wide range of extensions available that can be easily integrated into the application. These extensions cover various aspects such as database handling, form validation, authentication, and more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> Popular extensions include Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration, Flask-WTF for form handling, and Flask-Login for authentication."

    "App routing in Flask refers to the mechanism through which URLs (web addresses) are mapped to specific functions in a Flask application. This mapping allows you to define what should happen when a user accesses a particular URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, this is achieved using the @app.route decorator, which is used to bind a function to a URL. The function associated with a specific route is called a view function. When a user navigates to a URL, the corresponding view function is executed, and its return value is sent as the response to the user.\n",

    "3. Dynamic URLs: Routes can be dynamic, allowing you to capture variable parts of the URL and pass them to view functions. This is useful for creating dynamic and flexible web applications.\n",
