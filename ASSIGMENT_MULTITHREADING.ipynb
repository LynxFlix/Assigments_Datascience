    "1. Improved Application Responsiveness:\n",
    "    Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive while performing background tasks. For example, a GUI application can continue to respond to user inputs while performing time-consuming operations in the background.\n",
    "2. Efficient Resource Utilization:\n",
    "    Threads can share resources and data more efficiently compared to separate processes. This can lead to better utilization of system resources, such as memory, because threads within the same process share the same memory space.\n",
    "3. Enhanced Performance for I/O-bound Tasks:\n",
    "    Multithreading can improve performance in I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file operations, network communication) by allowing one thread to handle I/O operations while others perform computation or handle user interactions.\n",
    "4. Parallel Execution:\n",
    "    In some cases, multithreading can achieve parallel execution of tasks, particularly on multi-core processors where different threads can run on different cores simultaneously.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-> Disadvantages of Multithreading:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity in Program Design:\n",
    "    Designing and managing multithreaded applications can be complex. Issues such as synchronization, deadlocks, and race conditions can arise, requiring careful design and testing.\n",
    "2. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython:\n",
    "    In CPython (the standard Python implementation), the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the execution of Python bytecode to one thread at a time. This can reduce the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks in Python.\n",
    "3. Increased Resource Consumption:\n",
