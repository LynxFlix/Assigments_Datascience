    "-> Advantages of Using APIs:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automation: APIs allow for the automation of tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention. This can lead to increased efficiency and consistency in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Integration: APIs enable different systems and applications to communicate and share data, facilitating seamless integration across diverse platforms and technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: APIs can help scale applications by allowing them to leverage third-party services and functionalities without having to build those capabilities in-house.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Innovation: By providing access to external services and data, APIs can foster innovation and the development of new applications and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Efficiency: APIs can save development time and resources by allowing developers to use pre-built functions and services, rather than creating them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Disadvantages of Using APIs:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Integrating and managing multiple APIs can be complex, requiring careful handling of dependencies, versioning, and potential conflicts between APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Security Risks: Exposing APIs can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats. Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are necessary to mitigate these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dependency: Relying on third-party APIs can create dependencies that may lead to issues if the API provider experiences downtime, changes their API, or discontinues the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Limited Control: When using third-party APIs, developers have limited control over the external service's performance, reliability, and updates. Changes made by the API provider can impact the functionality of the integrated application.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cost: Some APIs come with usage fees, especially for high-volume or premium features. These costs can add up, particularly for applications with large user bases or extensive API usage."

    "1. Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. The server does not store any state about the client session.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Client-Server: The client and server are independent entities, allowing for scalability and flexibility in application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cacheable: Responses must explicitly define whether they can be cached or not, improving efficiency and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Uniform Interface: RESTful systems adhere to a uniform interface, simplifying and decoupling the architecture. This typically involves using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.\n",
