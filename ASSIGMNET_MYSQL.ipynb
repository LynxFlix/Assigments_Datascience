    "-> SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Structure:\n",
    "    SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "    They have a predefined schema and tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "2. Schema:\n",
    "    The schema is fixed and predefined. Changing the schema often requires significant modification to the database structure.\n",
    "3. Scalability:Typically, SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the load on a single server by adding more CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Examples:\n",
    "MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "->NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure:\n",
    "    NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store and retrieve data in a variety of ways, including key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, or document-oriented databases.\n",
    "    They do not have a predefined schema and are more flexible in terms of the data they can store.\n",
    "2. Schema:\n",
    "    No fixed schema, allowing for dynamic changes and scalability. Data can be added without predefining the structure.\n",
    "3. Scalability:\n",
    "    NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to handle increased load.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-> Examples:MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase."
