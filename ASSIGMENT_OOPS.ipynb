    "The four fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can help prevent unintended interference and misuse. Encapsulation hides the internal state of the object and only exposes a controlled interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse by allowing the subclass to use and extend the functionality of the superclass. It also establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to have different behaviors based on the object’s class. In essence, polymorphism provides a way to use a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features. It simplifies interaction with the object by providing a clear and simplified interface while concealing the underlying complexity. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and allows for a more user-friendly interaction with the object.\n"
